spam = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
spam.insert(2, 'hello')
print(spam)

#3. what does spam[int(int('3' * 2)//11)] evaluate to?

#let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions, 
bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

#6 what does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
#index of cat i.e 1
bacon.index('cat')

#7. what does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
# adds 99 to the end of the list
bacon.append(99)


#8. what does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
